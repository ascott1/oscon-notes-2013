# Hackerspaces: the new face of school – Nathan Dotz (All Hands Active)


In the near future, most "teachers" will actual be makers who directly inspire "students" by showing off their skills and projects" @isaiah_saxon

Education has become about something very different from making sure students are prepared with what they need (instead about jobs, unions, money, etc)


["The Silent Epidemic" report](http://www.ignitelearning.com/pdf/TheSilentEpidemic3-06FINAL.pdf)

Dropouts:

- 47% said classes weren't interesting
- 69% weren't motivated to work hard
- 81% called for more "real-world" learning opportunities
- 75% wanted smaller classes with more individual instruction


"By instilling values such as obedience to authority, promptness in attendance, and organizing the time according to bell ringing helped students prepare for future employment." - Horace Mann 

Frederick J. Kelly:

- Developed first multiple-choice test 1914
- "This is a test of lower order thinking for the lower orders"

To make this system work: amplify fear(and destroy passion)

Old school: society assumed that artists, singers, artisans, scientists, and alchemists would find their calling, then find a mentor, *then* learn their craft

New school: force kids to learn all the things so they can find the one they hate the least (maybe)

We teach kids what we think they might have a safe paycheck in

We can teach good attitudes:

- make commitments
- overcome fear
- deal transparently
- initiate
- plan a course
- desire lifelong learning
- express themselves
- innovate

Projects from All Hands Active:

- [Backyard Brains](https://backyardbrains.com/)
- Bright Futures (kind of like science latch key)
- [Aha Summer Camp](http://www.allhandsactive.com/young-gamers-summer-camp-curriculum/) (get kids together, make them play video games, sneak in how to plan and design a video game)
- [GEMSI](http://www.gemsi.org/about/whats-a-hackerspace/) - Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative

Model of the hacker space, used by:

- Khan Academy
- Grand Circus
- Girl Develop It
- Black Girls Code
- Rails Bridge
- etc

The teacher is no longer the gatekeeper to a world of information.

Turn your library into a place where people go to get handholding on something they've already learned/are excited about

[Why public libraries should follow Chicago’s lead and build maker labs](http://gigaom.com/2013/07/08/why-public-libraries-should-follow-chicagos-lead-and-build-maker-labs/)

Schools to coach seekers:

- We already have the best lessons from the ebst instructors pervasievely available
- Information gatekeepers become irrelevant
- The new school is one where we help students…
