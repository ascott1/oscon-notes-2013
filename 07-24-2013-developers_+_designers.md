# Developers + Designers: Collaborating on your Open Source project – Mark Lavin (Caktus Consulting Group), Julia Elman (Caktus Consulting Group)

Designers have a different perspective and training that can help a project

UI framework trap is limiting

Alternate perspective can bring new ideas to the project itself (it's about the development of the overall idea)

Keep your team diverse, but compact

Design decisions impact development work and development decisions impact design work

For designers: learning to code will make you a better designer

For developers: teaching/helping designers will be a win for everyone

## Workflows: How do we make collaboration easier?

- **Automate**: anything that is not the creation of the new idea can (hopefully) be automated. Then *everyone* can focus on creation.
- **Document**: document everything that can't be automated. Tailor them for a variety of different user. [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/)

It's ok to fail - everyone grows from the experience even if it becomes a failure

The conversations shaped the project - not just who wrote the code/made the commits

Free-flowing ideas/openness to feedback creates success

Important for everyone to be communicating and open *all the time*
