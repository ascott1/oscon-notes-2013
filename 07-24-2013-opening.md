## Open Intelligence — Jeffrey Hawkins

1. Discover operating principles of neocortex
2. Build systems based on these principles


Cortical Learning Algorithm(CLA) - 2009
NuPIC repository - 2013

Neocortex - all of your knowledge is stored in the nueral connections

Builds a sensory modal model of the world

**The CLA Theory**: 
- distributed sequence memory (learn semantic model from streaming data, infers and predicts)
- a key bulding block for machine intelligence

**NuPIC**: open source repo CLA


## Open Compute Project — Jay Parikh (Facebook)

## Creating Communities of Inclusion – Mark Hinkle (Citrix)

How we include more people in our community…

"… there isn't a one-size-fits-all model for successful open source projects. Governance models differ. Contribution and participations models differ. Naming and branding differes. What they do have in common is immense impact and huce success" - Mårten Mickos

Open Source Isn't a Zero-Sum Game

"If a new user has a problem it's a bug in the code or the documentation. End of story." - Jordan Sissel"

Include your users in the software process

Make it easy for people to help you

Open shouldn't end with software 
	- Jonathan Kuniholm, Open Prosthetic Project
	
What else communities of inclusion could accomplish…
- drug discovery
- cure cancer
- reduce fossil fuel dependencies
- (so much more)


## The Joy of Flying Robots with Clojure — Carin Meier (Neo)

No laptops/phones for hardware demo

## Open Source: The Secret Ingredient — Todd Greene (Media Temple)

Linux - one platform, six interpretations (like James Bond)

**Recipes** as open source have been around for centuries

### MediaTemple Values

- work with extraoirdinary people
- get things done
- design with simplicity
- be curious and experiment
- enjoy the journey


## inBloom Vision and Impact on Education — Sharren Bates (inBloom)

How are my students doing? What should we do next to help them succeed?

## Redefining What's Possible On Mobile and Cloud – Mark R. Shuttleworth (Founder of Ubunte, Canonical Ltd.)

"Compared to bee-keeping, spending time on open source mailing lists is wonderful."

Open source is about the tools of possibility.
