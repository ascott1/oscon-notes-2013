[O'Reilly History of Computer Programming Languages poster](http://oreilly.com/news/languageposter_0504.html)

1967 - creation of Simula 67 (first object oriented programming language)
1971 - Smalltalk
1983 - C++

No matter what programming language you're using, you need to start understanding how functional programming/thinking works

"OO makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts. FP makes code understandable by minimizing moving parts." - Michael Feathers

Functional is more a way of thinking than a tool set

Higher-order functions (first-class functions): functions that can either take other functions as an argument or return them as a result

Take data, augment with higher order function, customize machinery
