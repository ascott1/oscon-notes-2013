#Hardware Hacking With Your Kids â€“ Dave Neary (Red Hat)

The great thing about having kids is they're blank slates. You get to program them

Learned helplessness: We're breading a generation of young people whose world is read only

"Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact, and that is, everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you ... the minute that you understand that you can poke life ... that you can change it, you can mould it ... that's maybe the most important thing." - Steve Jobs

Freedom is not having to ask permission

## 6 tips for indoctrinating your kids in the hacker way

1. **Creative toys**

	Saying "you have to learn this, it's important" is the easiest way to get a kid to tune out
	
	- Kaplas
	- Ikea train sets
	- Meccano/Erector sets
	- Building blocks (Legos)

2. **Hackable living space**

	Giving the kids control over their own bedroom
	
	- Hanging art
	- Painting
	- Made a basketball hoop
	- Take whatever's lying around (homemade swing)
	
3. **Grow a garden**
4. **Arts and crafts**
	
	Keep supplies and tools lying around
	
	- Decorations
	- Costumes
	- Popsicle sticks and glue guns (container, bridge building)
	
5. **Teaching electronics**

	- Conductive putty
	- Taking apart toys
	- Arduino (pair programming with dad)
	- Soldering
	
6. Coding literacy

	- Arduino
	- Scratch
	- Codeacademy (for older)
	- Khan Academy computer science ("this is *amazing*")
	
**The key:** Trying to teach the kids that they have control over their environment.
