#Supercharged Human-Centered Design in Open Source Software – Tony Santos (Mozilla)

What is **human-centered design?** Human Centered Design is designing things with the focus of the people who are going to be using them

What is design?

"The details are not the details. They make the design." - Charles Eames

"Design is how it works." - Steve Jobs

**Design is planning.** 

Human-centered means putting humans at the center of our thinking.

Non-human-centered-design:

- Door with two pull handles
- Elevator picture (labeled colors, buttons with numbers and colors, unlabeled colors)
- Interface with tons of check-boxes, text-fields, etc.
- Nice looking, modern site that wanted an email address before looking at the page (might be business centered, but not human centered)
- RegEx

Why care?

If you don't care about the people using your thing, they won't care about your thing anymore.

We are special and love technology, but a lot of people don't… they care about using something that works for them.

Golden rule: **You are not your users**

"Trap of the elastic user" (when you don't have users or profiles)… run the risk change the user needs based on your own wants/opinions

Different flavors of users:

- Primary users (who it is that you're making the thing for): all of their needs should be met or else you've failed
- Secondary users: get almost everything that they want
- Negative users: who we're ignoring. this product isn't for them. Helps to start by making the negative users to whittle down who you are making this for

Empathy is at the core of human-centered design

There's designing *for* (one way chanel, not human-centered - It's *my* idea) or designing *with* (two way, find out how/why/where the software is being used)

Build empathy by:

- **Ask** - talk to your users
- **Observe**
- **Participatory Design** - research method where you get to both ask and watch. Done by designing *with.* Really useful in open source (because our ideas are open, anyone can take and improve)

How to run a participatory design session:

Get in a room with your users. Explain the problem you're trying to solve and work together to design a solution to the problem as they see it.

Patterns will start to emerge from participatory design.

Three ways to do participatory design:

1. Tell me a story…
2. Collage (interface components)
3. Sketch

Usability Testing:

- Really important
- "QA for your designs"
- Find people who are like your users and create tasks ("log in to your bank account and check your balance")
- There are online tools to do this
- These are like bug reports for your design

Recap:

1. Design is planning
2. Human-centered == human needs first
3. YOU ARE NOT YOUR USER
4. Define your users and write it down
4. Empathy is key
5. Participatory Design == best of asking and observing
6. Usability testing
